                        Hi, I’m Aleczia! I used to say that I was a foodie, but then food drastically changed my
                        life.<br>
                        Within the past year, I was diagnosed with over seven new food allergies. Suddenly, eating out
                        became stressful, social events felt overwhelming, and I started turning down invitations just
                        to avoid being “the difficult one.” I didn’t want to feel like a burden to my friends, so I made
                        excuses about why I couldn’t go out with them.<br>
                        I hope this website helps others facing the same challenges because we all deserve to enjoy food
                        without fear or embarrassment.
